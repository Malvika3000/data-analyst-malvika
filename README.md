## Project Summary 
  The goal of this cloud project is to create a Data Analytics Platform (DAP) for the City of Vancouver that is based on three municipal datasets: Building Water Treatment Systems, Decorative Water Features, and Cooling Tower Water.  From intake and profiling to transformation, governance, and monitoring, the project executes the full AWS workflow.  To guarantee performance, security, and data integrity, the solution makes use of Amazon S3, EC2, Glue Studio, Athena, and other AWS services.

**Project Title**: Water Quality Analytics and Transformation Using AWS Cloud Services

**Objective**
Developing a scalable, safe, and effective platform for consuming, profiling, cleaning, transforming, analyzing, and storing data on water quality is the aim of this project.  The datasets are ready for practical use by local government agencies through appropriate data engineering procedures on AWS.  By arranging data into approved and optimized Parquet formats, the initiative also makes it possible for future data science modeling.

**Dataset**
The datasets include water testing and inspection records collected from various city facilities:
- Cooling Tower.csv
- Decorative Water Feature.csv
- Building Water Treatment.csv
Each file contains critical parameters such as pH, chlorine level, temperature, and microbial data.

## Tools and Technologies Used in AWS:
**1. Data Ingestion and EC2 Setup**
EC2 Instance Name: VWQS-Malvi
